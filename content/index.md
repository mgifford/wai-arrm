### Summary

The Accessibility Roles and Responsibilities Matrix (ARRM) is a tool to help digital development project managers assign responsibility for various accessibility tasks across roles within the team. This page links to resources that comprise the ARRM.

The [ARRM Introduction](/planning/arrm/introduction "ARRM framework introduction") takes users through the steps they will follow to apply the ARRM methodology. Using the multi-step ARRM tool, users will be able to map specific accessibility tasks within their development life cycle to identified roles within the product team.

### Role-Based Decision Tree

The [Decision Tree](/planning/arrm/decision-tree "Role-Based Decision Tree") is a customizable framework to help teams define a matrix of their own within their organization. Use it to assign primary, secondary, or contributor level accountability for task-related responsibilities.

### Role Definitions

To avoid confusion around role-naming conventions, [Role Definitions](/planning/arrm/roles "Role definition document") are provided as a baseline to identify common stakeholders in a typical web development lifecycle.

### Responsibilities Matrix

Using the roles defined and agreed upon, the Matrix provides:

-   A set of role-specific grids for each role,
-   A set of ownership assignments for every WCAG Success Criteria
-   A set of sample considerations prioritizing responsibilities.
